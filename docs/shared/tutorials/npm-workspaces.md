# NPM Workspaces Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add Nx to a repository with an existing NPM workspaces setup. You'll see how Nx can provide immediate value with very little configuration and then you can gradually enable more features.

- Add Nx to the repository with a single command
- Configure caching for your existing tasks
- Configure a task pipeline
- Use Nx Plugins to automatically configure caching

<!-- ## Final Source Code

Here's the source code of the final result for this tutorial.

{% github-repository url="https://github.com/nrwl/nx-recipes/tree/main/npm-workspaces" /%} -->

## Starting Repository

To get started, check out [the sample repository](https://github.com/nrwl/tuskydesign) on your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nrwl/tuskydesign.git
```

The repository has two React packages (under `packages/buttons` and `packages/forms`) that are used in a `demo` application (located in `apps/demo`) that was designed to be used with the Vite CLI. The root `package.json` has a `workspaces` property that tells NPM how to find the projects in the repository.

```json {% fileName="package.json" %}
{
  "workspaces": ["packages/*", "apps/*"]
}
```

Because of this setting, when the install command is run at the root, the correct packages are installed for each project. NPM will create dedicated `node_modules` folders inside of each project folder where necessary.

```shell
npm install
```

Now let's try running some tasks. To lint the `demo` app, use the `lint` npm script:

```text {% command="npm run lint -w @tuskdesign/demo" path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
> @tuskdesign/demo@0.0.0 lint
> eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0
```

If you try to build the `demo` app, it will fail.

```text {% command="npm run build -w @tuskdesign/demo" path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
> @tuskdesign/demo@0.0.0 prebuild
> npm run typecheck

> @tuskdesign/demo@0.0.0 typecheck
> tsc

> @tuskdesign/demo@0.0.0 build
> vite build

npm ERR! Error: command failed
npm ERR!   in workspace: @tuskdesign/demo@0.0.0
npm ERR!   at location: /Users/isaac/Documents/code/tuskydesign/apps/demo
```

The `build` script fails because it needs the `buttons` and `forms` projects to be built first in order to work correctly. To do this, lets return to the root of the repository and run the `build` task for every project in the repo:

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npm run build --ws
```

When the `buttons` and `forms` projects are built first, the `demo` app can build successfully.

Now that you have a basic understanding of the repository we're working with, let's see how Nx can help us.

## Add Nx

Nx offers many features, but at its core, it is a task runner. Out of the box, it can cache your tasks and ensure those tasks are run in the correct order. After the initial set up, you can incrementally add on other features that would be helpful in your organization.

To enable Nx in your repository, run a single command:

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx@latest init
```

This command will download the latest version of Nx and help set up your repository to take advantage of it.

First, the script will propose installing some plugins based on the packages that are being used in your repository.

- Deselect both proposed plugins so that we can explore what Nx provides without any plugins.

Second, the script asks a series of questions to help set up caching for you.

- `Which scripts need to be run in order?` - Choose `build`
- `Which scripts are cacheable?` - Choose `typecheck`, `build` and `lint`
- `Does the "typecheck" script create any outputs?` - Enter nothing
- `Does the "build" script create any outputs?` - Enter `dist`
- `Does the "lint" script create any outputs?` - Enter nothing
- `Would you like remote caching to make your build faster?` - Choose `Skip for now`

```text {% command="npx nx@latest init" path="~/tuskydesigns" %}

 NX   üëÄ Explore Your Workspace

Run "nx graph" to show the graph of the workspace. It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
Read this guide on exploring your workspace: https://nx.dev/features/explore-graph
```

## Explore Your Workspace

If you run `nx graph` as instructed, you'll see the dependencies between your projects.

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx graph
```

{% graph title="Tusk Design" height="200px" jsonFile="shared/tutorials/npm-workspaces-project-graph.json" %}
{% /graph %}

Nx uses this graph to determine the order tasks are run and enforce module boundaries. You can also leverage this graph to gain an accurate understanding of the architecture of your codebase. Part of what makes this graph invaluable is that it is derived directly from your codebase, so it will never become out of date.

## Caching Pre-configured

Nx has been configured to run your `build`, `typecheck` and `lint` tasks. You can run a single task like this:

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx build @tuskdesign/demo
```

Or all tasks with a certain name like this:

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx run-many -t typecheck
```

During the `init` script, Nx also configured caching for these tasks. You can see in the `nx.json` file that the `build`, `typecheck` and `lint` targets have the `cache` property set to `true` and the `build` target specifies that its output goes to the project's `dist` folder.

```json {% fileName="nx.json" %}
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/dist"],
      "cache": true
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "cache": true
    },
    "lint": {
      "cache": true
    }
  },
  "defaultBase": "main"
}
```

Try running `build` for the `demo` app a second time:

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx build @tuskdesign/demo
```

The first time `nx build` was run, it took about 5 seconds - just like running `npm run build`. But the second time you run `nx build`, it completes instantly and displays this message:

```text
Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 3 out of 3 tasks.
```

You can see the same caching behavior working when you run `npx nx lint` or `npx nx typecheck`.

## Use Task Pipelines

You may be wondering why the caching message in the previous section mentioned 3 tasks when you only ran the `build` task from the terminal. When we said that `build` tasks must be run in order during the setup script, Nx created a simple task pipeline. You can see the configuration for it in the `nx.json` file:

```json {% fileName="nx.json" %}
{
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration means that if you run `build` on any project, Nx will first run `build` for the dependencies of that project and then run `build` on the project itself. The `^build` text means "the `build` tasks of the project's dependencies." You can visualize this in the Nx graph by selecting the `Tasks` dropdown in the top left and clicking `Show all tasks`:

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx graph
```

{% graph height="200px" title="Build Task Pipeline" type="task" jsonFile="shared/tutorials/npm-workspaces-build-tasks1.json" %}
{% /graph %}

With this pipeline in place, you will never run into the error we hit at the beginning of the tutorial where the `forms` and `buttons` packages weren't built so the `demo` app couldn't build. Test this out by deleting the `packages/forms/dist` folder and then re-running the `build` task for the `demo` app.

```text {% command="npx nx build @tuskdesign/demo" path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
...

 NX   Successfully ran target build for project @tuskdesign/demo and 2 tasks it depends on (40ms)

Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 3 out of 3 tasks.
```

Not only does the build complete successfully, but it finishes instantly and the `packages/forms/dist` folder is put back in place thanks to the caching.

## Create a Task Pipeline

You may have noticed in the `apps/demo/package.json` file, there is a `prebuild` script that runs `typecheck` before the `build` script in order to catch any type errors. Let's set up this same behavior in the Nx task pipeline as well.

```json {% fileName="nx.json" highlightLines=[5] %}
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build", "typecheck"],
      "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/dist"],
      "cache": true
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "cache": true
    },
    "lint": {
      "cache": true
    }
  },
  "defaultBase": "main"
}
```

The `dependsOn` line makes Nx run the `typecheck` task for the current project and the `build` task for any dependencies before running the current project's `build` task. Now `nx build` will run the `typecheck` task just like `npm run build` does.

## Use Nx Plugins to Enhance Vite Tasks with Caching

You may remember that we defined the `outputs` property in `nx.json` when we were answering questions in the `nx init` script. The value is currently hard-coded so that if you change the output path in your `vite.config.ts`, you have to remember to also change the `outputs` array in the `build` task configuration. This is where plugins can help. They directly infer information from the actual tooling configuration files (`vite.config.ts` in this case).

Nx plugins can:

- automatically configure caching for you, including inputs and outputs based on the underlying tooling configuration
- infer tasks that can be run on a project because of the tooling present
- provide code generators to help scaffold out projects
- automatically keep the tooling versions and configuration files up to date

For this tutorial, we'll just focus on the automatic caching configuration.

First, let's delete the `outputs` array from `nx.json` so that we don't override the inferred values from the plugin. Your `nx.json` should look like this:

```json {% fileName="nx.json" %}
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build", "typecheck"],
      "cache": true
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "cache": true
    },
    "lint": {
      "cache": true
    }
  },
  "defaultBase": "main"
}
```

Now let's add the `@nx/vite` plugin:

```{% command="npx nx add @nx/vite" path="~/tuskydesign" %}
‚úî Installing @nx/vite...
‚úî Initializing @nx/vite...

 NX   Package @nx/vite added successfully.
```

The `nx add` command installs the version of the plugin that matches your repo's Nx version and runs that plugin's initialization script. For `@nx/vite`, the initialization script registers the plugin in the `plugins` array of `nx.json` and updates any `package.json` scripts that execute Vite related tasks. Open the project details view for the `demo` app and look at the `build` task.

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx show project @tuskdesign/demo
```

{% project-details title="Project Details View" jsonFile="shared/tutorials/npm-workspaces-pdv.json" %}
{% /project-details %}

If you hover over the settings for the `vite:build` task, you can see where those settings come from. The `inputs` and `outputs` are defined by the `@nx/vite` plugin from the `vite.config.ts` file where as the `dependsOn` property we set earlier in the tutorial in the `targetDefaults` in the `nx.json` file.

Now let's change where the `build` results are output to in the `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts {% fileName="apps/demo/vite.config.ts" highlightLines=[7-9] %}
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: '../../dist/demo',
  },
});
```

Now if you look at project details view again, you'll see that the `outputs` property for Nx's caching has been updated to stay in sync with the setting in the `vite.config.ts` file.

You can also add the `@nx/eslint` plugin to see how it infers `lint` tasks based on the ESLint configuration files.

## Summary

After following this tutorial, the repository is still using all the same tools to run tasks, but now Nx runs those tasks in a smarter way. The tasks are efficiently cached so that there is no repeated work and the cache configuration settings are automatically synced with your tooling configuration files by Nx plugins. Also, any task dependencies are automatically executed whenever needed because we configured task pipelines for the projects.

The final task graph for `demo` app's `build` task looks like this:

{% graph height="200px" title="Build Task Pipeline" type="task" jsonFile="shared/tutorials/npm-workspaces-build-tasks2.json" %}
{% /graph %}

## Manage Releases

If you decide to publish the `forms` or `buttons` packages on NPM, Nx can also help you [manage the release process](/features/manage-releases). Release management involves updating the version of your package, populating a changelog, and publishing the new version to the NPM registry.

First you'll need to define which projects Nx should manage releases for by setting the `release.projects` property in `nx.json`:

```json {% fileName="nx.json" %}
{
  "release": {
    "projects": ["packages/*"]
  }
}
```

Now you're ready to use the `nx release` command to publish the `forms` and `buttons` packages. The first time you run `nx release`, you need to add the `--first-release` flag so that Nx doesn't try to find the previous version to compare against. It's also recommended to use the `--dry-run` flag until you're sure about the results of the `nx release` command, then you can run it a final time without the `--dry-run` flag.

To preview your first release, run:

```shell
nx release --first-release --dry-run
```

The command will ask you a series of questions and then show you what the results would be. Once you are happy with the results, run it again without the `--dry-run` flag:

```shell
nx release --first-release
```

After this first release, you can remove the `--first-release` flag and just run `nx release --dry-run`. There is also a [dedicated feature page](/features/manage-releases) that goes into more detail about how to use the `nx release` command.

## Set Up CI for Your NPM Workspace

This tutorial walked you through how Nx can improve the local development experience, but the biggest difference Nx makes is in CI. As repositories get bigger, making sure that the CI is fast, reliable and maintainable can get very challenging. Nx provides a solution.

- Nx reduces wasted time in CI with the [`affected` command](/ci/features/affected).
- Nx Replay's [remote caching](/ci/features/remote-cache) will reuse task artifacts from different CI executions making sure you will never run the same computation twice.
- Nx Agents [efficiently distribute tasks across machines](/ci/concepts/parallelization-distribution) ensuring constant CI time regardless of the repository size. The right number of machines is allocated for each PR to ensure good performance without wasting compute.
- Nx Atomizer [automatically splits](/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks) large e2e tests to distribute them across machines. Nx can also automatically [identify and rerun flaky e2e tests](/ci/features/flaky-tasks).

### Generate a CI Workflow

If you are starting a new project, you can use the following command to generate a CI workflow file.

```shell
npx nx generate ci-workflow --ci=github
```

{% callout type="note" title="Choose your CI provider" %}
You can choose `github`, `circleci`, `azure`, `bitbucket-pipelines`, or `gitlab` for the `ci` flag.
{% /callout %}

This generator creates a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file that contains a CI pipeline that will run the `lint`, `test`, `build` and `e2e` tasks for projects that are affected by any given PR.

The key line in the CI pipeline is:

```yml
- run: npx nx affected -t lint test build
```

### Connect to Nx Cloud

Nx Cloud is a companion app for your CI system that provides remote caching, task distribution, e2e tests deflaking, better DX and more.

To connect to Nx Cloud:

- Commit and push your changes to GitHub
- Go to [https://cloud.nx.app](https://cloud.nx.app), create an account, and connect your repository

#### Connect to Nx Cloud Manually

If you are not able to connect via the automated process at [nx.app](https://cloud.nx.app), you can connect your workspace manually by running:

```shell
npx nx connect
```

You will then need to merge your changes and connect to your workspace on [https://cloud.nx.app](https://cloud.nx.app).

### Enable a Distributed CI Pipeline

The current CI pipeline runs on a single machine and can only handle small workspaces. To transform your CI into a CI that runs on multiple machines and can handle workspaces of any size, uncomment the `npx nx-cloud start-ci-run` line in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

```yml
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --distribute-on="5 linux-medium-js" --stop-agents-after="e2e-ci"
```
